AI-Powered Diagnostics: Enhancing Tuberculosis and Malaria Detection through Medical Imaging

## Getting Started

This project aims to develop an AI-powered solution for analyzing medical images to assist in the rapid and accurate diagnosis of tuberculosis and malaria. By leveraging advanced image analysis techniques, the project seeks to address the challenges of delayed and misdiagnosis, particularly in resource-limited settings where access to skilled healthcare professionals is scarce. The solution aims to enhance diagnostic efficiency and support public health initiatives to combat these significant infectious diseases.
